## Challenges

What to do about 'react-rails' gem that has many dependencies?

What to do about nav bar when favorite list is too long ?

How to set up components?
	- error search bar plus message so could add 'id = "errors" ' for CSS
	- search results together
		- could make dependencies their own component but would make favoriting more complicated
	
What if favorites list gets long ?
	Pagination.
